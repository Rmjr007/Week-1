# 🌱 Green Policy Simulator for Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption

### 📅 Week 1 – Project Setup & Dataset Preparation

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Green Policy Simulator** is an AI-driven project designed to study how different **government policies** affect **Electric Vehicle (EV)** adoption.
Using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Generative AI (GenAI)**, this system forecasts EV cost/adoption trends and simulates policy interventions such as subsidies, tax rebates, and infrastructure improvements.

The project also includes a **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard**, enabling users to visualize and test different policy scenarios dynamically.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict EV cost and adoption trends using real-world data.
* Simulate and visualize the effects of green policy interventions.
* Generate synthetic “future” datasets using Generative AI.
* Create an interactive **Streamlit** interface for policy simulation.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Despite a global push toward sustainable mobility, EV adoption remains uneven due to varying incentives, infrastructure gaps, and regional policies.

This project aims to answer:

> **“How can AI and Generative Models help governments design effective policies to accelerate EV adoption?”**

## 📊 Dataset

**Dataset Used:** [EV Adoption Trends Worldwide (2015–2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/ev-adoption-trends-worldwide-20152023)

### Key Features:

* Global EV sales data
* Charging infrastructure and availability
* Market share by country and manufacturer
* Policy metrics and incentives

The dataset helps identify which factors most strongly influence EV adoption over time.

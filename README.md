# Week-1
Green Policy Simulator for Electric Vehicles (EVs) Adoption

#📘 Project Overview
This project explores how **green policies** (like subsidies, charging infrastructure expansion, or tax rebates) can influence **EV adoption trends**.  
Using **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**, the goal is to simulate and visualize the potential impact of various government interventions on the growth of Electric Vehicles.

---

# 🎯 Objectives
- Predict EV adoption or cost trends using real-world data.
- Simulate the impact of different policy scenarios.
- Generate synthetic “future” datasets using Generative AI.
- Create an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** for visualization and policy simulation.

# 🧠 Problem Statement
Despite global efforts toward sustainable mobility, EV adoption is uneven due to varying policy incentives.  
This project aims to answer:
> “How can AI and Generative Models help forecast and optimize policy decisions for faster EV adoption?”
